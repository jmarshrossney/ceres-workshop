If you found the previous parts of this task easy and want to try something more challenging, these extensions are for you.


Do a hyperparameter search
--------------------------

Use a `Grid Search <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html>`_ to search through hyperparameters of your choosing and find an optimal set.


Create a map visualisation for the data
---------------------------------------

In the ``dataset.ipynb`` notebook, create a visualisation of the dataset as a set of points on a map (or, perhaps more appropriately, on more than one map).

Make sure you can distinguish between images containing ships and images without ships, e.g. based on the colour of the points.

As an extra challenge, can you make it so that clicking on a point brings up information on that image?
How about clicking on a point displays the image itself in the corner of the map?

**Python:**

* `Official Python 3 documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/>`_
* `Official Package index <https://pypi.org/>`_
* `Geeks for Geeks Python tutorials <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=shm>`_


**Git and GitHub:**

To bring up the help pages from your terminal: use the ``--help`` option, e.g.

.. code-block::

    git diff --help

* `Github help pages <https://docs.github.com/en>`_
* `git commands reference <https://git-scm.com/docs>`_, `git cheat sheet <https://training.github.com/>`_, and `a visual git cheat sheet <https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;>`_
* `Github Desktop homepage <https://desktop.github.com/>`_


**Conda and packaging:**

* `Conda user guide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html>`_ and `Conda cheat sheet <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html>`_
* `Mamba installation instructions <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
* `Conda-lock <https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock>`_ - if you really care about reproducibility and want to use Conda, you should use this instead of ``conda env export``
* `Conda Forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ - where you will find (almost) all of the packages you need
* `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ - an alternative way to manage dependencies and virtual environments which is (unlike Conda) Python-specific. I highly recommend using this over Conda if you work exclusively in Python
* `Flit documentation <https://flit.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ - we used this to build our own packages

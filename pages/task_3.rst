Task 3: Introducing PyTorch
===========================

In this task we're going to approach the same binary classification problem as in the first task.
However, this time we will use the much more powerful and flexible PyTorch library.

The code for this task (as with the first) is based on `this repository <https://github.com/marshrossney/ships-in-satellite-imagery>`_.

How to approach this workshop
-----------------------------

I've tried to design the workshop so as to be useful for people with various degrees of experience.

:For those with little programming experience:
    Work through the tasks slowly, paying attention to each step.
    Refer to workshop and external resources.
    Consider taking notes as you go.
    Don't worry about the extension tasks!

:For those with experience of languages such as MatLab, but not Python:
    The completed tasks should serve as a useful reference for Python semantics and design patterns.


:For experienced Python programmers:
    You'll probably find most of the tasks straightforward.
    Perhaps use this opportunity to dig deeper into issues such as dependency management and reproducibility.
    Try the extension tasks!

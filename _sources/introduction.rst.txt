*Welcome!*

This workshop is entirely based on three tasks.
The idea is to make a start on all three of them during the afternoon.
If there are parts you don't finish this afternoon, you may want to continue working on them in your own time, in which case you should feel free to email me with any queries.

As you go you should have hopefully learn a bit about

* Writing clear Python code in line with modern standards and conventions
* Managing a virtual environment using Conda
* Using Git and GitHub to version-control your code
* Packaging your Python project
* Good practices for Machine Learning

I've tried to design the workshop so as to be accessible to relative beginners, but still useful for experienced Python programmers.
Hence, I recommend basing the way you approach the tasks depending on your experience.

**For those with little programming experience:**
Work through the tasks slowly, paying attention to each step.
Refer to workshop and external resources.
Consider taking notes as you go.
Don't worry about the extension tasks!

**For those with experience of languages such as MatLab, but not Python:**
The completed tasks should serve as a useful reference for Python semantics and design patterns.
Pay particular attention to the way Python projects are organised into packages and how dependencies are specified and managed.


**For experienced Python programmers:**
You'll probably find most of the tasks straightforward.
Perhaps use this opportunity to dig deeper into issues such as dependency management and reproducibility.
Try the extension tasks!

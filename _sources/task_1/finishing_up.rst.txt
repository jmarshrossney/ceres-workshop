Finishing up
============

Merge the pull request
----------------------

Once you have finished the task, you can merge your pull request with the ``main`` branch.

Go to the pull request on GitHub and hit the 'merge' button.
You will probably want to 'squash' your commits into one.

.. important:: Make sure you have *pushed* all of your local changes to the remote before merging the pull request!


Pull updates to the local repo
------------------------------

Finally, we need to update the local repository, since the ``main`` branch has changed.

To do this, run the following commands:

.. code-block::

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main


You've completed the first task - **Congratulations!**

Aside: Complex Numbers
======================

Don't be alarmed by the presence of ``complex`` in the code.
In Python, ``complex`` objects support most of the same operations as ``float``s do.
Given two ``float``s ``x`` and ``y``, a complex number ``z`` can be created ``z = complex(x, y)``.
If you're not familiar with complex numbers, just think of them as coordinates z = (x, y) in a two-dimensional plane.

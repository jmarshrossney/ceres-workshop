Task 1: Fractals
================

Fractals are really cool.
In this task you will make some visualisations of some well-known fractals such as the one above.

This is meant to be fun, and perhaps even pique your interest in the maths behind these amazing patterns, but the main aim here is to become familiar with the structure of a Python project, some common design patterns, and some key developer tools. There is no need to care about the maths unless you really want to!

Remember, you can bring up the documentation for any Python object using ``help(object)`` or, if you're using IPython, just ``object?``.
